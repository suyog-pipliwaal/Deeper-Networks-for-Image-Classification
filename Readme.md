# Deeper Networks for Image classification
One of the main problems in computer vision is the image classification problem, which is concerned with determining the presence of visual structures in an input image. 

Image classification analyzes the numerical properties of various image features and organizes data into categories. 
In recent years, many advanced classification approaches, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy-sets, and expert systems, 
have been widely applied for image classification, but each of them having some problems and their accuracy level is comparatively less. 

One of the advanced classification approaches is to use the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture of deep learning which 
obtains successful results in solving many machine learning problems.


The **proposed method** is trained and tested on MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset and achive classification accuracy of **99.7% and 84.9%** respectively
